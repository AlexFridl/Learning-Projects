# vue_app_1

This project was created to practice the basics of Vue.js and working with Axios to fetch and display data from a local JSON file.
It represents a simple job search website that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete job listings.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3 (Vite)** – frontend framework and build tool

- **Axios** – for fetching data from JSON

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6)**

- **Vue Router** – for navigation between pages
