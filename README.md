# Learning Projects

This repository contains projects I built while practicing and exploring different technologies.  
Each folder represents a separate project created to test specific concepts, frameworks, or programming techniques.  

Some of these projects were made simply as practice exercises, while others were created to address gaps in my knowledge and help me develop specific skills or learn something new.  
The goal of these projects is not to deliver production-ready applications, but to experiment, improve my coding skills, and apply them in practice.

Each project will include its own README file with more details about the technologies used, features implemented, and instructions for running it.
